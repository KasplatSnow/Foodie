### XP Core Value

1. Communication
   Communication was one of the key strengths of our team. We held meetings every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, ensuring regular touchpoints to stay aligned. During these meetings, we discussed challenges, reviewed our progress, and planned the next steps. This structure ensured that everyone was on track and had a clear understanding of their tasks. If team members encountered any issues or needed assistance, we encouraged them to reach out through Discord for quick chats or calls.

2. Feedback
   We prioritized providing feedback during our sprint meetings. By addressing issues early, we minimized recurring mistakes and improved overall productivity. Additionally, we conducted thorough code reviews at the end of each sprint. This practice helped ensure that all changes were well-documented, error-free, and ready to merge into the master branch without risking production stability.
